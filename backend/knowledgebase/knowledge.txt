Important Questions

Answers

Why This Matters:

What is the overall
deductible?

$2,500/individual or $5,000/family

Are there services
covered before you meet
your deductible?

Yes. Preventive care services are
covered before you meet your
deductible.

Are there other
deductibles for specific
services?

No.

Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all
family members meets the overall family deductible.

This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.
But a copayment or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan covers certain preventive
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.

You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for
other costs for services this plan covers.

What is the out-of-pocket
limit for this plan?

$7,350/individual or $14,700/family

The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the
overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.

What is not included in
the out-of-pocket limit?

Will you pay less if you
use a network provider?
Do you need a referral to
see a specialist?

Premiums, balanced-billing
charges, and health care this plan
doesn’t cover.

Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.

No network restrictions.

 N/A

No.  You don’t need a referral to see
a specialist.

You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.

doesn’t cover.

No network restrictions.

No.  You don’t need a referral to see
a specialist.

Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all
family members meets the overall family deductible.

This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.
But a copayment or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan covers certain preventive
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.

You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for
other costs for services this plan covers.

The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the
overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.

Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.

You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.

amounts (deductibles, copayments and coinsurance) and excluded services under the plan. Use this information to compare the portion of

Important Questions

Answers

Why This Matters:

What is the overall
deductible?

$7,350/individual or $14,700/family

Are there services
covered before you meet
your deductible?

Yes. Preventive care services are
covered before you meet your
deductible.

Are there other
deductibles for specific
services?

No.

What is the out-of-pocket
limit for this plan?

$7,350/individual or $14,700/family

What is not included in
the out-of-pocket limit?

Will you pay less if you
use a network provider?
Do you need a referral to
see a specialist?

Premiums, balanced-billing
charges, and health care this plan
doesn’t cover.

No network restrictions.

No.  You don’t need a referral to see
a specialist.

Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this
plan begins to pay.  If you have other family members on the plan, each family member must
meet their own individual deductible until the total amount of deductible expenses paid by all
family members meets the overall family deductible.

This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible amount.
But a copayment or coinsurance may apply.  For example, this plan covers certain preventive
services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered
preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/.

You don’t have to meet deductibles for specific services, but see chart starting on page 2 for
other costs for services this plan covers.

The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services.  If you have
other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out-of-pocket limits until the
overall family out-of-pocket limit has been met.

Even though you pay these expenses, they don’t count toward the out-of-pocket limit.

You can see the specialist you choose without permission from this plan.
